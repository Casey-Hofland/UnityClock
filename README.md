# About Unity Clock

![Unity Clock Showcase](https://github.com/CaseyHofland/com.caseyhofland.unityclock/assets/27729987/9d9b4c43-1f8c-4777-a387-d9a0e3a6c42b)

Unity Clock is a time-of-day system that allows full creative flexibility with a non-destructive workflow. The core philosophy is centered around the utilization of [Animation Clips](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationClips.html) to allow full creative flexibility in how an object should change over time. They can also be previewed in the editor without triggering scene changes, which is a huge benefit when you're working with version control systems like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Plastic](https://www.plasticscm.com/).
